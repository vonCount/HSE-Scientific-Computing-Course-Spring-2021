"Open" licenses

Here's a list of some of the important families of open-source software licenses, along with a couple examples of who is using them:

"Open" families; they have similar terms:

Apache: Android, many Java projects
BSD: openssh
MIT: ruby
Exercise: read the Wikipedia articles on Apache, BSD, and MIT licenses. Describe the similarities and the differences.

"Libre" licenses

The libre licenses have a bit more spread in content; we include a brief description:

LGPL: used for libre libraries for embedding in proprietary software
GPL2: used for libre software; any "derived work" must also use GPL2
GPL3: similar to GPL2, with guarantees to prevent "locking" of devices for, e.g., DRM; and with improved compatibility with AGPL and Apache-licensed code.
AGPL3: similar to GPL3, with guarantees of source code to users of the software-as-a-service
Exercise: read the History section of the Wikipedia article on GPL.


Exercise: Pick a creative work (or make up a fictional one); come up with three obviously non-commercial uses of this work.

Exercise: Now argue that all three of these uses are commercial.

A major problem in modern neural methods is the availability of data sources. For high-performance neural systems, large corpora are required; but most of the time these corpora are found by scraping websites or asking companies politely.

Exercise: What is the effect on science reproducibility if the data set is not liberally licensed?

Exercise: give an example of a proprietary data source; what could you do with that data if it were liberally licensed?

OpenStreetMap is one of the largest and most successful open data sources in the world; they use the Open Data License.
