Exercise: Write a simple RFC561-compliant e-mail.

Exercise: Send yourself an e-mail with non-ASCII characters. (E.g., "привет!") Download the raw message and open with a text editor. What are the contents? How is the message encoded, and where is the encoding specified? (Sometimes you need to select "view message source" or "view original message" to do this.)

Exercise: How are attachments handled? Refer to the Wikipedia article on MIME; send yourself an e-mail with a (very small!) attachment, and download the raw e-mail message and open with a text editor. What are the contents? Show and explain each MIME part. Can you recover the attachment from the raw message?

IRC

IRC is a chat system dating back to the late 1980s; it is the default chat system in the libre software and hacker communities. The protocol is open, and the core protocol can easily be implemented in a few days hacking.

IRC lacks many features some have come to expect from chat systems: history, images, formatting, etc, are all lacking. Read Drew DeVault's commentary for a counter-point.

Due to its openness and flexibility, IRC is a very popular place for bots; most major channels have at least one bot moderating them.

Exercise: Install an IRC client, log in to freenode.net, join #apertium and write a message "begiak: tell nlhowell hi". It will instruct the bot managing #apertium to forward me the message next time it sees me.

Exercise: Find a piece of software that you use which has an IRC channel for support. Ask a question there about the software. Include your conversation, and a brief description of your experiences.

Matrix

Matrix is a new messaging and communication system being developed to replace IRC. Many of the absent features of IRC are included in Matrix; generally, however, the protocols are very different.

Matrix is also an open protocol, and there are many different open-source clients and servers in development; there are also many projects to "bridge" with other chat systems. Matrix bridges exist for telegram, IRC, whatsapp, and others, allowing the Matrix user to connect to many different chat platforms.

Exercise: together with a friend, try out the Riot.im web client. How does it compare to IRC? To Telegram?
